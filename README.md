Hello, my friend, everything's fine with you? I hope so!

I've made this project to help in BoardGames that we commonly use hourglass to clock countdown. Maybe you were got crazy like me when someone answers a question and looking through hourglass you can't figure out if the sand is more in some side, and ask yourself If I turn this upsidedown, will be faster or not? 

Looking here in my cabinet with a lot of little electronics things I decided to put some parts together and solve this question. 

My idea is to simply show in Neopixel Bar the countdown, and with a simple button press, restart the clock. Some features that I'd like to have


- [ ] Configuration to set amount time will be count.
- [ ] Battery-powered
- [x] Code update over the air
- [ ] Webserver with statistics (maybe in realtime)
- [ ] 3D printed case
